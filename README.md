# BadgeFactory
Simple factory class for building numbered badges for Android

## Dependencies
This depends on being in an Android Project.  It is supported for api level 10+.

## Usage

Using it is easy:  Copy paste/ pull the repo
Change Namespace to your own.  

Thats it!  From there you can use it within your adapter classes.

## TODOs

* Allow for different shapes as badges (Stars anyone)?
* More shader effects.
