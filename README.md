# BadgeFactory
Simple factory class for building numbered badges for Android

## Dependencies
This depends on being in an Android Project.  It is supported for api level 10+.

## Installation

Sorry folks, doesn't warrant having its own artifact at this point, HOWEVER installing it is easy:

* clone repo OR simply copy paste class into your project
* Change Namespace to your own, it won't compile until you do

Thats it!  From there you can use it within your adapter classes:

```java

public Adapter(Context) {
    this.mFactory = 
}

```

## TODOs

* Allow for different shapes as badges (Stars anyone)?
* More shader effects.
